**CURE Algorithm Overview**
The CURE (Clustering Using Representatives) algorithm is a hierarchical clustering method designed to efficiently cluster large datasets by iteratively merging data points into representative clusters. It starts by initializing each data point as a separate cluster and assigning a representative point for each cluster. Outliers are then removed to enhance the robustness of the clusters. The algorithm proceeds with hierarchical clustering, iteratively merging the closest clusters until a specified number is reached. After each merge, the representative points and sizes of the clusters are updated. CURE is particularly effective in handling large datasets, accommodating irregularly shaped clusters, and demonstrating robustness to outliers. Its key features include the use of representative points, hierarchical clustering, and a cluster shrinkage step to improve cluster separation. The provided Java implementation of the CURE algorithm allows users to efficiently apply this clustering approach to their datasets.<br></br>

<h2>Initialization</h2>
- Begin with each data point as a separate cluster.
- Assign a representative point for each cluster.

**Outlier Removal:**
- Identify and remove a certain percentage of data points that are farthest from the cluster's representative point. This helps in reducing noise and outliers.

**Hierarchical Clustering:**
- Apply hierarchical clustering to the remaining data points. This involves iteratively merging the two closest clusters until a specified number of clusters is reached.

**Representative Update:**
- Update the representative points for each cluster to be the mean of the points in that cluster.

**Cluster Shrinkage:**
- Shrink the size of each cluster by a certain factor, typically by a percentage of the distance between the representative point and the farthest point in the cluster.

**Repeat:**
- Repeat the above steps until the desired number of clusters is reached.

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
**Representative Points:**
- Each cluster is represented by a point, which is chosen as the centroid or mean of the points in the cluster.

**Outlier Removal:**
- CURE removes a certain percentage of outliers to improve the quality of clusters.

**Hierarchical Clustering:**
- The algorithm employs hierarchical clustering to iteratively merge clusters until the desired number is reached.

**Cluster Shrinkage:**
- The size of each cluster is reduced to improve cluster separation.

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
**Large Datasets:**
- CURE is designed to efficiently handle large datasets that may not fit into memory.

**Irregularly Shaped Clusters:**
- CURE can be effective in identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes.

**Robustness to Outliers:**
- The outlier removal step enhances the algorithm's robustness to noisy data.

**Shrinkage Factor:**
- The factor by which the clusters are shrunk during the cluster shrinkage step.
